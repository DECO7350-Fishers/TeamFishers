## Functions
### Highlighting Bills
We provided several ways to present the bills for users. On the Dashboard, there are three ways to check the bills: User information section for the total bill. Bills for each room. The variation tendency in week/month. After user set the Target, a warning will pop-up when the consumption greater than the target.

### Monthly Water Consumption Visualization
The color circle visualized the monthly water usage in each room. At the same time, the details of usage of facilities are provided in the Rooms section 
visualizing by charts.

### Collecting Water Saving Tips
This function enhance the communication between users. Chatbot can guide users to find specific tips, and input original water saving tips. All the tips 
are sorted by family size and shared automatically for making sure users can get suitable tips.

### Novel Function - Party Mode
This mode can be turned on from Settings section, and also can be turned off at any time. The water usage is set already by users and will be included in total consumption after conversion.


## Summary

### Problem Space
Domain: Water Conservation

Water conservation is the practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage [1].

Problem Space: Low Household Water Saving Efficiency

Improving living standards and the deployment of a bewildering variety of water-saving technologies make people use water unconsciously. Most people view water as an essential tool for daily cleaning and never care about unnecessary waste [2]. Additionally, the unconsciousness of water usage after applying water-saving equipment leads to a rising frequency of using water, which further leads to a rebound in water usage, and a series of water-saving measures gradually lose their real effect [3]. In one word, most household water-saving equipment has difficulties in meeting their expected water-saving efficiency.

### Design Concept
According to background research and interviews, we found that the lack of specific knowledge of water consumption and insensitivity to water charges are the fundamental reasons why users cannot have sustainable water-saving habits. Therefore, we need to develop a system that can provide real-time water consumption and costs, and the visualization of system data is our focus.

This system is presented at home in the form of a screen embedded in the kitchen walls or living room to disclose water usage information. Each family member can share the system's water information, which forms a kind of sociality.

In the interview, we found that the lack of knowledge about water-saving is also a reason for the low water-saving efficiency. Therefore, while highlighting water use visualization, we also actively push some water-saving tips for users to further improve water-saving efficiency.

Finally, we intend to use rankings to increase competition and interaction among families in the community for sociality. According to the feedback of the interview, users do not mind ranking with other families but do not want to disclose their detailed personal information because this may violate their privacy. Therefore, we intend to set up a ranking mechanism that conceals water usage information and actively recommends that users with the top rankings push their water-saving experience through voice input.

### Social and mobile theory

#### Visual design

Since our system adopts a distinctive visual presentation method, the system fully includes artifact visual design elements: aesthetic, functional, and symbolic dimensions. Users can feel the visual and psychological impact from the real-time changes of processing bar and numbers, thereby changing the way and consciousness of water use. This visualization reflects the functional and symbolic qualities mediate the relationships between aesthetic quality and intention to use in visual design.

#### Social interaction

We use fun and appropriate metaphors (ranking and chatbox) to enhance the vividness of competition and communication among users. Our water-saving system allows users to share water-saving experiences with each other to expand the audience of water-saving activities and increase the systemâ€™s activity in the family. The ranking reflects the contrast and competition contained in most social media without infringing on user privacy, making water-saving a virtuous circle.

### Design Solution
1.We developed a system that can provide real-time water consumption and costs, and the visualization of system data is our focus.

2.This system is presented at home in the form of a screen embedded in the kitchen walls or living room to disclose water usage information. Each family member can share the system's water information, which forms a kind of sociality

3.While highlighting water use visualization, we also actively push some water-saving tips for users to further improve water-saving efficiency.

4.Finally, we intend to use rankings to increase competition and interaction among families in the community for sociality.We set up a ranking mechanism that conceals water usage information and actively recommends that users with the top rankings push their water-saving experience through voice input.
